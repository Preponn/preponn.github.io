So the question always remains, exactly how many words are one required to internalize? Our experts shall only be able to answer this question by reviewing your existing vocabulary. Rest assured, we do not recommend learning a quarter of a million words from the dictionary. We employed the best-practices from the industry to devise a variety of fun tool-based approaches, respecting multiple-intelligences. We ensure that you only learn as many words as you really ever require to score a 160+ in this section. We also help make vocabulary fun. </p><p class="text-justify lh-4 fs-6 px-3"> As far as reading goes, we lay emphasis on the transition words, to check direction as you read. This makes it easier to read loosely for the Main Idea, Structure, and Author’s Side, even before answering the questions. Additionally, it is always a good idea to attempt answering the questions by yourself, using information from the passage, without looking at the answer choices. In order to achieve this, we can’t stress enough on practising reading from multiple resources, especially from The Official Guide to the GRE General Test. </p><p class="text-justify lh-4 fs-6 px-3"> It is too simplistic to claim that the two scored Verbal sections consist of an equal number (20 each) of vocab- and reading-based questions. This is because both the skills are really integrated in all of the questions. To add to the complexity, our research through the recent tests has shown that the GRE is evolving their vocab questions by using apparently less eclectic words, but more convoluted structures; In this case, reading regains focus. </p><p class="text-justify lh-4 fs-6 px-3"> As a rule of thumb, our approach for reading varies with the length of the passages. While longer passages deal with the entire structure, shorter ones require in-depth reading between sentences. Again, there is nothing subjective about the GRE. We handhold you through the process of effectively working with an Error Log, so you may learn the art of objectively looking for the credited responses, while eliminating incorrect answer choices using trap words, on sight (sometimes, even without reading the questions). </p>',9),_={class:"text-center fw-bolder fs-5 mt-5"};function x(v,q){const i=r,o=h;return d(),c("main",null,[s(i,{course:"GRE"}),e("div",p,[e("div",g,[e("div",m,[s(o,{to:"/course/gre/register",class:"text-white heading text-decoration-none p-1 rounded-0 me-2"},{default:a(()=>[t("Register Now")]),_:1}),t(" and get your scores improved !
