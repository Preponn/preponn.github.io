I have been learning math from Preponn Education for about one year. With the help of my teacher, Digvijay Singh, I finished the entire AB calculus curriculum the summer before junior year, and because of that I have <span class='tmh'>96% in BC Calculus</span> . Additionally, I scored a <span class='tmh'>1560 on my SAT</span> with a perfect <span class='tmh'>800 on my SAT math</span> section on my first try on August 29th. I believe Preponn is a great service for all kinds of academic help and test prep because it is so convenient and offers top level quality with reasonable prices. Additionally, my teacher is very knowledgeable, and has not yet failed to clarify or explain concepts I am struggling with. Every difficult concept is explained so thoroughly and every question is answered so well that it makes the subject seem almost simple. The voices of instructors are very clear and easy to understand, and technical problems are rarely an issue. Lastly, extra practice is always given, and instructors will answer any questions you may have even outside of class time.

Through their simple yet effective style of teaching, they allowed me to grow my skills in the realm of math. The entire structure of the course was personalized for me, and this allowed me to move at a pace perfect for me.
